Teagarden
=========

Teagarden is a django based webapplication used for database planning and 
modelling during the software development process. With Teagarden, software 
developers and database architects can create database tables, fields, 
constraints and relations without specifying the database system they want to 
use for their project. Teagarden aims to be a database development platform and 
documenation tool, but can also create the final SQL statements and compares the 
specific, productive database against the modelling metadata schema.

Why "teagarden"?
================
As this application is based upon the web framework Django and it was named 
after "Django Reinhardt", a famous jazz musician, I thought of giving my project 
also a name of a jazz legend. So I called it "teagarden", named after the famous 
jazz trombonist `"Jack Teagarden"`__.
